# Purpose:
To create a database of the top 500 movies from 2019 to 2024 for a general purpose, broad audience.
We selected movies that had 1000 or more vote counts, with the highest vote average, to ensure we had the top 500 selections.

This database allows you to search for:

  The top 10 English movies 
  
  Top 10 foreign language movies
  
  Movie overviews by movie name
  
  Top 10 movie by year (between 2019 to 2024)

# Instructions on how to use and interact with our movie database:
We have provided APIs which allow people to interact with our database of the top 500 movie titles between 2019 to 2024

The user can query:

The Top 500  Movies

A movie overview by entering the name of the movie

The top 10 movies of any year between 2019 to 2024 by entering the year

The top 10 English language movies

Or the Top 10 foreign language movies

# Ethical Considerations
We excluded adult only movies in an attempt to develop a database that would be intended for general or broad audiences, even though the data we extracted was already available in the public domain.    The promotion of adult content raises several ethical concerns such as exploitation, or harm to persons involved in the industry or viewing these types of movies.
